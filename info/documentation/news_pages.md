# News, events, and Other Posts

---

## Overview

The "posts" mechanism powers all regularly updated items except seminar talks (those a powered by google calendars, see [here]({{site.url}}/doc/seminars/) for details). Examples of these include:

- Event announcements (such as graduation)
- Conference announcements
- Award announcements
- Job opportunities
- IMS lecture announcements
- Any other department news

Each post corresponds to a file located in the `_posts/` folder or one of its subfolders (subfolders in `_posts/` are there purely for convenience and do not affect the resulting website). The file has a certain structure described below. The filename has to follow an exact pattern, namely, it **must** look like

{% highlight yml %}
YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-the-post.md
{% endhighlight %}

Here `YYYY-MM-DD` better correspond to `date:` configuration variable in the post.
The post itself has its own page. By default, its address is formatted as
`{{site.url}}/YYYY/MM/name-of-the-post`, where `YYYY`, `MM`, and `name-of-the-post`
come from the file name. This default address can be changed by setting the
`permalink:`  configuration variable.

#### Lecture 1: The rank of elliptic curves

[FURTHER_CONTENT]
{% endhighlight %}

### Content

The first 17 lines define many configuration variables for the post. The
rest of the file (after the second `---`) is the content of the post.
Note the separator `<!--more-->`. The content above it is the
post excerpt which is displayed in all post rolls, and the content below it is displayed
only on the page of the post, cf. [the post roll]({{site.url}}/newsletter/) and a [page
of the post]({{site.url}}/2016/06/bulletin/).

One image to the post can be added to be handled automatically (to be displayed in nice size in both post rolls
and on the post page). More images can be added manually as needed, both above and below the excerpt separator.

The syntax of the content (both above and below the excerpt separator) is [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Math formulas are also [supported]({{site.url}}/doc/math/).
As usual, plain HTML is supported inside markdown.

### Configuration variables

Let us now describe the configuration variables (not all of them are present above),
and how they affect the presentation of the post.

<span class="nonupper-h5">published</span>

Setting `published: false` will remove the post from the website
completely (but it will stay in the [GitHub source](https://github.com/uva-math/uva-math-code)). By default this variable is set to `published: true`, so it can as well be omitted.

<span class="nonupper-h5">layout</span>

Should be set to `layout: post`, simple as that. By the way, the post layout `_layouts/post.html`
determines how the individual post page looks like.

<span class="nonupper-h5">comments</span>

The comments feature is not yet implemented, but if it will be implemented then
`comments: false` will disable comments (this will be the default setting),
and only manually setting `comments: true` will enable comments.
Therefore, this variable can simply be not present in posts.

<span class="nonupper-h5">title</span>

Well, this is the title of the post which is displayed in both post rolls and
on the post page.

<span class="nonupper-h5">date</span>

This is the published date of the post which may not coincide with the
actual date of the event.
It should coincide with the date in the filename of the post `.md` file.
It is also displayed as "date published" at the bottom of the post page

**Note.** The `date` (and `event-date` below) should be formatted with hours, minutes and seconds, as in
`date: 2017-03-27 13:30:00`. Hours, minutes, and seconds are displayed nowhere,
and they are used only to determine the ordering of the posts when they are shown in a roll.

<span class="nonupper-h5">event-date and multi-day-event</span>

These two variables allow to indicate the date of an event, if a post is announcing
an event such as IMS lectures or a conference. If the post is not about an event,
simply do not include these variables.

The value `event-date` is displayed under the title of the post. If `multi-day-event` is set to `true`,
the text before the date says "Event start date", otherwise the text says "Event date".

<span class="nonupper-h5">permalink</span>

If you do not like the default address `{{site.url}}/YYYY/MM/name-of-the-post`
of the post page, you can manually set it to something else, as
in `permalink: /ims/lectures/benedict-gross/`.
You can include any subfolder names in the permalink.

<span class="nonupper-h5">categories</span>

This is an important variable because it determines where the post is displayed.
The currently used categories on the website are (the list below is generated automatically),
to give an idea of standard post categories:

{% assign sorted_cats = site.categories | sort %}
<ul>
{% for category in sorted_cats %}
<li><code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ category | first }}</code></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

A post can have several categories.

By default, all published posts (i.e., not with `published: false`) are displayed
on the ["all news" page]({{site.url}}/allnews/). If you add `news`, then the post
will be displayed on the main page (note that the main page displays only 5 most recent posts).
And so on, see [below](#displaying-posts) for a detailed description.

<span class="nonupper-h5">hide-this-item</span>

Setting `hide-this-item: true` will hide the news item from the main page,
even if it is not yet pushed back by newer news items. This can be handy for
some small news once the time passes. However, this key does not hide this news item from the
general news roll at [`{{site.url}}/allnews/`]({{site.url}}/allnews/).
By agreement, major news will not be hidden like this, only the ordinary news.

<span class="nonupper-h5">more-text</span>

This is the text on the "more" button at the bottom of the post excerpt,
which can be configured to make more sense. For example, for IMS lectures
it can say "Abstracts", for Virginia Math Bulletin it can say "Start reading", and so on.
If this is not defined, then the text at the bottom of the post excerpt
says simply "View details".

<span class="nonupper-h5">nav\_parent</span>

This variable is specific to the IMS lectures (and typically should not be used for any other posts).
It is used to highlight the IMS navigation bar item which clearly corresponds to the IMS lectures.
See [here]({{site.url}}/doc/static/) for details on how pages interact with the navigation bar.

<span class="nonupper-h5">variables related to post image</span>

Posts look nicely with images.
One image to the post can be added to be handled automatically (to be displayed in nice size in both post rolls
and on the post page). The variables `image`, `image-alt`, `image-address`, `image-tall`, and
`image-wide` determine how this image is handled.
More images can be added manually as needed, both above and below the excerpt separator.

If you do not want an automatically handled image in the post, simply omit these image variables.

<span class="nonupper-h6">`image`</span>

Put the image file into the folder `/img/news_events/` or simply into `/img/` in the source code (or a proper another subfolder of `/img/`, or even into a different subfolder like it is done for the math bulletin; the only desire is that this should be more or less consistent). Link the image in the post file like this: `image: __SITE_URL__/img/IMS/Gross_poster.jpg`.

**Important!** keep the `__SITE_URL__` prefix as is, this is needed for correct automatic generation of the website.

<span class="nonupper-h6">`image-alt`</span>

This is the alternative text and title of the image. This can be empty, but better to put there something
informative, maybe also even the title of the post.

<span class="nonupper-h6">`image-address`</span>

This is a link to where a click on the image leads.
If no link address is provided, then by default the link address
is the address of the post page.
However, sometimes it makes sense to have a link to an external resource
or to a PDF or a larger copy of the image.
In case of internal links, use the `__SITE_URL__` prefix in the addresses,
as in the `image` variable.

<span class="nonupper-h6">`image-tall` and `image-wide`</span>

If the image is wide and can occupy a wider part of the post excerpt,
then set `image-wide: true`. If the image is tall
and normally takes too much vertical space, then set `image-tall: true`.
How these variables is handled is specific to each post roll,
and this can be easily configured. These variables are very optional,
and should not be included for more or less square images.

## <a name="displaying-posts">Where posts are displayed</a>

The posts are automatically displayed in a number of pages, including the following.

**Note.** This information is current as of May 2025.

### [Department main page]({{site.url}})

The main department page [{{site.url}}]({{site.url}}) has three display areas for news posts:

1. **Carousel/Swiper**: The top section displays up to 6 recent posts with the `swiper-news` category in a rotating carousel.
2. **Featured Box**: Below the carousel, one post with the `major-news` category (but not having `swiper-news`) is displayed in a larger gray box.
3. **News Grid**: Finally, up to 6 recent posts with the `news` category (excluding those already shown in the carousel or featured box) are displayed in a grid format.

If a post does not have the `news` category, it will not be displayed on the main page. Most posts should have the `news` category.

#### Display Control Categories:

- `news` - Required for posts to appear on the main page in any section
- `swiper-news` - Includes post in the carousel/slider at the top of the main page (limited to 6 posts)
- `major-news` - Makes a post appear in the larger featured box (when not also in the carousel)

Only one `major-news` will be displayed in the featured box, even if there are several such posts available. If you want to highlight a particular post, add the `major-news` category to it, and consider removing this category from other posts. The `major-news` category only affects posts displayed on the main page.

### ["All news" page]({{site.url}}/allnews/)

This page collects and displays **all** posts on the website, and features "pagination", i.e.,
creates pages which show 8 posts each, with navigation on the right.
The subsequent pages have addresses like [{{site.url}}/allnews/page2/]({{site.url}}/allnews/page2/).
Even if a post does not have category `news` it will be displayed here.
To remove a post from the website set the configuration variable `published: false`.

### Pages displaying posts by category

These pages are displaying every post having a certain category.
They do not have the "pagination", that is, they can grow up to dozens of entries over
time. This issue will be addressed in the future as needed.
One possible immediate solution is to have an `archive` category or a configuration variable,
and not display
archived posts there.

Again, even if a post does not have category `news` it will be displayed in the corresponding
page below if it has a suitable category.
To remove a post from the website set the configuration variable `published: false`.

##### [IMS lectures]({{site.url}}/ims/lectures/)

This page has some general information on the IMS Virginia Mathematics Lectures,
and also an archive of all the IMS lectures posts.
Posts having category `virginia-mathematics-lectures` appear there.

##### [Virginia math Bulletin]({{site.url}}/newsletter/)

This page collects issues of Virginia Math Bulletin.
Posts having category `virginia-math-bulletin` appear there.

##### [Awards]({{site.url}}/awards/)

This page collects information on awards in the department (both faculty and student).
Posts having category `awards` appear there.

##### [Conferences]({{site.url}}/conferences/)

This page collects conference announcements.
Posts having category `conferences` appear there.

##### [Job opportunities]({{site.url}}/job-opportunities/)

This page collects postings of job opportunities.
Posts having category `jobs` appear there.
