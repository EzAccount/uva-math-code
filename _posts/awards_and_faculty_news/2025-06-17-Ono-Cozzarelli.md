Ken Ono's 2024 paper "Integer partitions detect the primes" in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, with former UVA student William Craig and collaborator Jan-Willem van Ittersum, has been recognized as a finalist for the [Cozzarelli Prize](https://www.nasonline.org/news/2024-cozzarelli-recipients/). The paper was selected as a runner-up in the Physical Sciences and Mathematics category from among 3,200 papers published in PNAS last year. This marks the first time a paper in pure mathematics has been recognized by this prestigious award since 2005.

An article describing this work appeared in [Scientific American in June 2025](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mathematicians-hunting-prime-numbers-discover-infinite-new-pattern-for/).
