Ph.D. student Louisa Liles has been selected as a MOST (Mathematics Outreach Seminar and Training) Fellow with the National Museum of Mathematics in New York. This selective program, funded by the Simons Foundation, develops female mathematicians' ability to share their knowledge and research with the general public in an engaging way. As part of the fellowship, Louisa will attend a workshop at the museum this summer and return in 2026 to give a public lecture. She will also present to middle and high school students in the community, serving as a role model for young women interested in STEM.
