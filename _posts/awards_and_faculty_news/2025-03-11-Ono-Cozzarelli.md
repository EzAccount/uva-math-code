Ken Ono's 2024 PNAS paper ["Integer partitions detect the primes"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2409417121) with former UVA student William Craig and collaborator Jan-Willem van Ittersum has been recognized as a finalist for the [Cozzarelli Prize](https://www.nasonline.org/news/2024-cozzarelli-recipients/). The paper was selected as a runner-up in the Physical Sciences and Mathematics category from among 3,200 papers published in PNAS last year. This marks the first time a paper in pure mathematics has been recognized by this prestigious award since 2005.
