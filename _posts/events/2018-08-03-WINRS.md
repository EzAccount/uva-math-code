A one day <a href="http://www.people.virginia.edu/~sm4cw/WINRS.html">conference</a> featuring plenary talks, student talks, poster session, a career and mentoring panel, AWM Student Chapter discussion, and tutorials at all levels. 

<!--more-->

The conference objective is to introduce students and faculty, in particular women, to ongoing research in the Mid-Atlantic region and bridge gaps between universities. We aim to connect women in similar mathematical fields, as well as promote collaboration and share strategies for addressing issues facing women and other underrepresented groups in math. The conference is open to everyone, regardless of gender identity.

This conference is organized in Cooperation with the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) and supports the Non-Discrimination Statement of the Association for Women in Mathematics.
