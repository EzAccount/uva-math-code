The University of Virginia will host an in-person workshop for early career mathematicians working in geometric group theory on May 9-12, 2025. The workshop will feature three minicourse series by Harrison Bray (George Mason), Didac Martinez-Granado (Luxembourg/NUS), and Jenya Sapir (Binghamton), with supporting introductory talks by Madeline Horton, Meenakshy Jyothis, and Aisha Mechery. The talks are aimed at graduate students and postdocs and will be accompanied by discussion sections. Remote access will be available via Zoom.

The workshop is organized by Matthew Gentry Durham (UCR) and Thomas Koberda (UVA), and is supported by NSF grant DMS-2500706.
