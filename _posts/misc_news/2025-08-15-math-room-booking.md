The Department of Mathematics has launched a new **Meeting Room Booking System (MRBS)** to manage all departmental room reservations. **Bookings made through MRBS are official**—the department office uses this calendar as the *authoritative source* for scheduling.

* You should have received a link to create your MRBS **username and password**.
* **Anyone** may view the calendar without logging in.
* **Logged-in users** may create **up to five non-recurring bookings**.
* To request a **recurring booking** (e.g., weekly meetings or a course pattern), **please contact the Mathematics Department office**.

### Links

* **View the calendar (no login required) at the link on the right of the main page:** [MRBS Main Calendar](https://math.virginia.edu/mrbs/index.php)
* **How to book / FAQs:** [MRBS Help](https://math.virginia.edu/mrbs/help-uva.php)

### Contact

* **Department Office:** Kerchof Hall, Room 216
* **Technical Support:** Leo Petrov — [petrov@virginia.edu](mailto:petrov@virginia.edu)

Please use MRBS for all room requests going forward. This will keep our shared spaces organized and ensure that schedules are accurate and up to date.
