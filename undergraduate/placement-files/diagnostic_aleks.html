<h1 class="mb-4">ALEKS Diagnostic</h1>

If you took the pilot ALEKS diagnostic assessment in Summer 2025, thank you for your participation! 

Since this is a pilot program, we will not make any placement recommendations at this time. In particular, your score on the ALEKS diagnostic assessment will not be used to determine which math course you should take this fall. Regardless of your score, you are encouraged to remain enrolled in the math course you have already selected. 

Nevertheless, we know you must be eager to learn more about how to interpret your score! This score represents the percentage of ALEKS topics you’ve mastered so far. Whatever your score might be, please don’t worry, this diagnostic does not impact your math course enrollment or your math course grade in any way. Instead, we want it to be an informative tool for you to understand what topics to brush up on before the start of the semester. Below is a video guide of how to use the Prep and Learning Modules in ALEKS for you to get ready for the beginning of the semester.
