<h1 class="mb-4">ALEKS Diagnostic</h1>

If you took the pilot ALEKS diagnostic assessment in Summer 2025, thank you for your participation! 

Since this is a pilot program, we will not make any placement recommendations at this time. In particular, your score on the ALEKS diagnostic assessment will not be used to determine which math course you should take this fall. Regardless of your score, you are encouraged to remain enrolled in the math course you have already selected. 

Nevertheless, we know you must be eager to learn more about how to interpret your score! This score represents the percentage of ALEKS topics you’ve mastered so far. Whatever your score might be, please don’t worry, this diagnostic does not impact your math course enrollment or your math course grade in any way. Instead, we want it to be an informative tool for you to understand what topics to brush up on before the start of the semester. Below is a video guide of how to use the Prep and Learning Modules in ALEKS for you to get ready for the beginning of the semester.

After taking the diagnostic test, you will be able to see your ALEKS Learning Pie by clicking on the three lines at the top left corner and selecting “Reports”. If you click View Full Report on the “Learning Pie” tab, you will see details of which topics you still need to work on in order to get prepared.

To learn the topics you haven’t yet mastered, click on the three lines on the left corner and click “Learn”. This will take you to the Learning Modules, where you are able to freely choose from topics to practice on. You are also welcome to view full solutions to example problems in order to learn.
