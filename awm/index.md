### Who are we?

<span align="justify"> The <a href="https://awm-math.org">Association for Women in Mathematics</a> is a national organization whose goals are encouraging women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and promoting equal opportunity and  equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences.
We are the student chapter of the AWM at the University of Virginia. Our goal is to provide opportunities for all students, regardless of gender identity, to be exposed to the world of professional mathematics, to obtain information about the varied career options in mathematics, to network with professional mathematicians, and to develop leadership skills.
If you would like to participate in any of our events, check out our <a href="{{site.url}}/awm/calendar/">calendar</a> and just show up! If you would like to be part of our mailing list, please send us a message ({% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="brh5c" %} or {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="jlm6cj" %}) and we will send you a message whenever we schedule a new event.
