When creating a new announcement, the file name should include today's date (the creation date) rather than the date of the event being announced.

For example:
Correct: 2023-11-15-announcing-upcoming-holiday-party.md (where 2023-11-15 is today's date when the announcement is created)
Incorrect: 2023-12-20-announcing-upcoming-holiday-party.md (where 2023-12-20 is the date of the holiday party itself)
